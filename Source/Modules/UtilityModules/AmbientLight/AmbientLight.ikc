<class name="AmbientLight" description="Calculare the ambient light at a place and tine using various methods">


	<description>
		The module AmbientLight calculates the light based on a tiem and location. The location is given by its latitde and lngitude and the initial time is given by the year, month and day. 
		The module always starts at midnight and uses the internal ikaros time to update its output. Note that the time is interpreted as local time at the location. 
		This means that if two instances are running for different locations, the time will not be the same for both of them, i. e. as they both start at their respective local midnights.

		There are several methods to calculate the ambient light:

		12_12 produceses as 12h:12h light dark cycles. Full on or off regardless of the set location.

		DSR calculates the Diffuse Sky Radiation (DSR) at a place and time based on ChatGPT's interpretation of the model proposed by Erbs et al. 1982. May be wildly inaccurate.
