# ikaros-3

Ikaros is an open framework for system-level brain modeling and real-time robot control. Ikaros supports the design and implementation of large-scale computation models using a flow programming paradigm.

More than 100 persons  contributed to the code base of earlier versions and over [100 scientific publications](http://www.ikaros-project.org/publications/) report on work that has used Ikaros for simulations or robot control.

Ikaros 2 is described in the article [Ikaros: A framework for controlling robots with system-level brain models](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1729881420925002).

Version 3 is completely rewritten in modern C++ and includes a number of new features.

This version is currently in development and not ready for use.

For now, please use the [previous version](https://github.com/ikaros-project/ikaros) instead.

## Basic Start-up Parameters

    usage: ikaros [options] [variable=value] [filename]

            Command line options:

            -S (start):  start-up automatically without waiting for commands from WebUI
            -b (batch_mode): start automatically and quit when execution terminates
            -d (tick_duration): duration of each tick
            -h (help): list command line options [true]
            -r (real_time): run in real-time mode
            -s (stop): stop Ikaros after this tick [-1]
            -w (webui_port): port for ikaros WebUI [8000]
            -x: activate experimental features

        filename :   ikg-file to load

All parameters can be set in the root element of the ikg-file as well.

## Timing

Timing is set by the *real-time* flag together with the desired *tickduation*. Tickduation defaults to 1 s.

All times are set in seconds as a double.

On Mac OS the timing error is below 0.2 microseconds.

The following functions should be used for all timing calculations and work both in real-time and simulated time.

 Function | return type |Real-time | Simulated time  |
| ----|----|----|----|
| GetTick() | tick_count  |tick | tick |
| GetTickDuration() | double  | tickduration | tickduration
| GetTime() | double  | GetRealtime() | tick * tickduration
| GetRealTime() | double  | timer.GetTime() | tick * tickduration
| GetLag()  | double  | tick * tickduration - timer.GetTime() | 0

GetLag() returns the lag at the time of calling and can be used to adjust for jitter within a module. It is not necessarily the same as the *lag* value in the kernel.
